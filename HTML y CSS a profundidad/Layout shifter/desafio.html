                <p>The Marine</p>
                <p>Marines are the all-purpose infantry unit produced from a Barracks. Having the quickest and cheapest production of all Terran units make the Mineral backbone that scales very well with Stimpack, Engineering Bay upgrades and Medivacs from the Starport. Before Stimpack, Marines are less than effective against Zerglings and Zealots; at least one Bunker and Supply Depots to wall-off is recommended for the early game.</p>

                <p>The Hydralisk</p>
                <p>The Hydralisk is a ranged Lair-tech unit that can be morphed after building a Hydralisk Den. The Hydralisk's fast attack and high damage, along with not relying on bonuses to specific unit types, makes it consistently effective at dealing damage to both ground and air targets. Can morph into the Lurker after morphing the Hydralisk Den into a Lurker Den.

                Due to the large difference in speed off-creep and on-creep, the Muscular Augments upgrade and/or spreading creep should be a key focus when executing any Hydra-based strategy.</p>

                <p>The Zealot</p>
                <p>The first and strongest unit of direct army attacks. A strong brute-force unit and excellent mineral dump as well. In terms of health and damage this unit is second to none of the basic units.

                However, in the early game it is kited extremely easily by any ranged unit; so Stalkers are recommended for chasing pesky units while waiting for the Twilight Council to finish researching Charge, which brings the Zealot's health and damage to bear as a real threat.</p>
