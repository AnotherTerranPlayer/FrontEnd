            <article>Following his performance at GPL 2015 Season 3 Premier League, he was invited to become a member of X-Team at the beginning of 2016.

                He became famous in NEO Star League 2016 International, where he beat MarineLorD 2-0 through his strongest matchup (TvT).
                
                In the 3rd place playoff of WESG 2017 - Asia-Pacific Qualifier, he beat Maru 3-2 in an official offline tournament.
                
                After One More was disbanded, Oliveira joined Clan SCBoy for 4 months before leaving. After being teamless for another 4 months, he joined Newbee in the Summer of 2018.
                
                In 2018 WCS Montreal, Oliveira reached a new milestone in his SC2 career. He never expected himself to go that deep into the tournament. Oliveira defeated Has 3:2, who was the runner-up of 2018 WCS Valencia, and he advanced to the quarterfinals. In Ro8, he surprised most people by sweeping the series against HeRoMaRinE, one of the best EU Terran players, 3:0. Before him, the Chinese audience had sorely missed one of their own players in the semifinals, the last two being MacSed & Jim in 2013. Even though Reynor ended Oliveira's journey, he had a bright future in the coming years.</article>
